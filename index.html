            What is the 54‑Day Novena?
          </h2>
          <p>
            <span class="font-semibold">Origin:</span> Originated in the late 19th century in Naples, Italy, the 54 Day Novena is attributed to a young girl suffering from an illness thought to be incurable. Calling on Mary for help, Mary appeared to her and promised her healing if she prayed three novenas. The girl did so, and was miraculously healed. In a later apparition, Mary specified that the full prayer should have 3 novenas in petition, and 3 novenas in thanksgiving.
          </p>
          <p class="italic text-indigo-900 font-medium">
            “Hail, Queen of the Most Holy Rosary, my Mother Mary, hail!”
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="font-semibold">The devotion:</span> The 54 Day Novena is a beautiful devotion that consists of saying a Rosary for 54 days in a row (with a few extra prayers within the Rosary). A novena means praying 9 days in a row, so the 54 Day Novena is, in essence, 6 novenas: the first 3 novenas over the first 27 days are said in petition – asking Mary for her prayers for a particular intention. The remaining 3 novenas said over the last 27 days are in thanksgiving, whether or not you received what you brought to prayer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="font-semibold">Breakdown:</span> 54 days = 6 novenas: 3 in petition (27 days), 3 in thanksgiving (27 days). 3 sets of mysteries. For each novena you’ll say each set of mysteries 3 times in this order: Joyful, Sorrowful, Glorious — Joyful, Sorrowful, Glorious — Joyful, Sorrowful, Glorious. The Luminous mysteries weren’t around when the 54 Day Novena started — though you certainly can include them if you’d like!
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="font-semibold">Why pray?</span> This novena is a prayer for all seasons of life. You can pray the 54 Day Novena when you are suffering yourself, you’re making a big decision, you’re looking for work, or simply looking to grow closer to Mary. Suffering comes in many forms, but so does healing. We pray this beautiful devotion to grow in relationship with Mary and trust in the Lord — maybe even in hope of a miracle like the young girl from Naples. However, we know that prayer is not magic — many of us will pray this novena and not have our prayers answered in the way we hoped. We pray this 54 Day Novena in the hopes that no matter what, God’s will may be done.
          </p>
           <p>
            <span class="font-semibold">When to pray?</span> We pray this prayer in times of suffering, hope, and need when we can dedicate time and practice patience for 54 days of praying with the Blessed Mother. Some people like to begin or end on a Marian feast day, but any day will do. It’s often helpful to have a partner to pray with to keep each other accountable.
